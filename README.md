# Pet Adoption Portal
A full-stack web application that connects users with adoptable pets from a shelter. Users can easily search and filter pets based on location, species, breed (possibly price too). Built using React for the frontend and Python + FastAPI for the backend, with MongoDB for the database.

## Main features: 
* searching for pets by their location, race, breed
* searching for services, such as grooming and training
* 2 types of users: customers & administrators
* shelter admins have the option to add / remove / update pets and their info
* ability for users to leave feedback
  
## Other features, such as an AI model recommending you pets based on natural language preferences, may come along the way but these are current main ones so far.
