# Pet Adoption Portal
A full-stack web application that connects users with adoptable pets from multiple shelters. Users can easily browse, search, and filter pets based on breed, age, temperament, and shelter location. Built using React for the frontend and ASP.NET Core for the backend, with MySQL for the database.

## Main features: 
* searching for pets by their traits & the option to adopt them
* 2 types of users: customers & shelter administrators
* shelter admins have the option to add / remove / update pets and their info
* ability for users to leave a rating and/or review of the pet
  
## Other features may come along the way but these are current main ones so far.
